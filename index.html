		<h2> About me</h2>
		
		<p> Working in the financial techonoloy industury futher peaked my interest in coding so much so that I began taking classess at Penn State University online over a year ago.
		    It was super interesting. I was always fasinated with computers, so learning how to code only reinforced my fascination and passion. I am happy to continue my coding 
		    journey with Thinkful. So far I have learned a lot and can't wait to learn more!
